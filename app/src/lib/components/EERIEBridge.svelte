				Seeing the Moments That Hint at the Real Problem
			</h2>

			<!-- NFY opening (shame dissolution first) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-900 leading-relaxed font-semibold text-center">
				This isn't unusual.
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed text-center mb-8">
				Most organizations reach this point long before they realize it.
			</p>

			<!-- Observable pressure moments (optimized spacing) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Finance asks for ROI and there's no clear answer.<br />
				Someone notes the pilot has been running for eight months with no path to production.
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				A senior engineer leaves and everyone knows the workload is about to shift again.
			</p>

			<!-- Developer protection: new discipline, not team weakness -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Your developers are doing everything they can — but AI application development is a new discipline.
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Traditional software engineering doesn't map cleanly to LLM behavior, orchestration, safety boundaries, or production-grade data dependencies. Teams are learning while building, often without a clear definition of "production-ready."
			</p>

			<!-- Board pressure + stalled progress (micro-rhythm) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				The board review approaches.<br />
				The update deck looks the same as last quarter.<br />
				Priorities shift. Ownership is unclear.<br />
				Progress feels stuck even though everyone is working hard.
			</p>

			<!-- Emotional velocity moment (pattern interrupt) -->
			<div class="py-6 my-6 border-y-2 border-slate-300">
				<p class="text-2xl text-slate-950 leading-tight font-bold text-center italic">
					Everyone's working. But nothing's moving.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Future pacing insertion -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				But picture the opposite for a moment:
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Your team aligned, dependencies mapped, blockers visible, and every hour of work actually moving an initiative closer to production.
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-900 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
				That's what becomes possible once the pattern is clear.
			</p>

			<!-- Structural pattern (no redundancy) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Work that demos well but can't run in production.
			</p>

			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed italic">
				It's not a leadership failure. It's a structural pattern.
			</p>

			<!-- Enemy externalization: environment, not capability (shorter lines) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
				Not because the technology failed — but because the environment wasn't designed to support production.<br />
				The roadmap didn't account for the eight blockers.<br />
				Teams compensate instead of escalating.<br />
				Functions negotiate control instead of aligning.
			</p>

			<!-- The 12% differentiation + clarity promise (isolated for impact) -->
			<p class="text-lg text-slate-900 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
				Once you see which blocker you're facing — and what the 12% who reached production did differently — the next step becomes clear.
