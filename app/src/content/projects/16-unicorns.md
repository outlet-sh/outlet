# About 16 Unicorns

16 Unicorns is a culture diagnostic that helps organizations understand the patterns that shape how they work. Not surface-level culture like ping pong tables and happy hours. The deep patterns. The ones that determine whether teams move with clarity or confusion, whether decisions happen fast or drift, and whether people build momentum or burn out.

Most leaders know culture matters. But culture feels vague, subjective, hard to measure. 16 Unicorns makes it tangible. It identifies the core patterns that govern how your organization operates, reveals where those patterns help or hurt, and shows you exactly where to focus if you want real change.

The diagnostic is built on years of working inside fast-moving companies, watching what makes teams thrive and what makes them stall. It distills that experience into a framework that's practical, clear, and immediately useful.

## My Role

I created 16 Unicorns from the ground up. The framework, the diagnostic methodology, the pattern recognition model, the assessment design, and the interpretation system. It draws from my work helping executives navigate uncertainty, build high-performing teams, and create organizations that scale without losing coherence.

My goal was simple: give leaders a tool that reveals the truth about their culture in a way that's clear, actionable, and free of consultant fluff.

## What It Does

16 Unicorns assesses organizational culture across core dimensions that actually matter:

- **Decision patterns** - How information flows and choices get made
- **Execution patterns** - How work gets prioritized and completed
- **Communication patterns** - How ideas spread and feedback travels
- **Learning patterns** - How knowledge compounds or evaporates
- **Trust patterns** - How psychological safety enables or blocks performance
- **Innovation patterns** - How new ideas emerge and gain traction

The output isn't a score or a generic report. It's a clear picture of your culture's operating system, with specific insights about what's working, what's breaking, and where to intervene for maximum impact.

## Who It's For

16 Unicorns is designed for:

- Executives building or transforming organizations
- Leaders who sense cultural friction but can't pinpoint the source
- Teams experiencing growth pains or performance plateaus
- Organizations preparing for major change (M&A, restructuring, scaling)
- Anyone who wants to understand the invisible forces shaping their company

## Status

16 Unicorns is currently in development. The diagnostic framework is complete. The assessment instrument is being refined. Early access will be available soon for leaders who want to see their culture clearly and shape it intentionally.
