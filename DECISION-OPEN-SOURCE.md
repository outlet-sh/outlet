# Decision: Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

## Summary

Outlet.sh is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

## Why AGPL?

The AGPL ensures that:

1. **Network use triggers copyleft** - If you run a modified version of Outlet.sh as a service (SaaS), you must release your source code under AGPL.

2. **Protects the community** - Prevents companies from taking the code, modifying it, and offering it as a competing service without contributing back.

3. **Encourages contribution** - Anyone who improves the software must share those improvements.

## What this means for users

- **Self-hosting**: You can freely self-host Outlet.sh for your own use
- **Modifications**: You can modify the code for your own use
- **Distribution**: If you distribute or offer as a service, you must:
  - Release your modifications under AGPL
  - Provide access to the complete source code
  - Preserve copyright notices
