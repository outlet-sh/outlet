# Outlet.sh – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Date:** January 05, 2026  
**Author:** Alma Tuck  
**Product:** Outlet.sh  
**Version:** 1.0 (Launch)  
**Technical Stack:** go-zero framework for REST API

---

## 1. Product Overview

Outlet.sh is a modern, self-hosted newsletter, marketing, and transactional email platform positioned as the spiritual successor to Sendy—faster, simpler to deploy, and built on contemporary Go tooling with AI-native capabilities.

**Core Promise:** A complete email system (marketing + transactional) that runs reliably on a $4/month VPS, sends 10,000 emails for $1 via Amazon SES, includes AI-powered sequence building via MCP, and is purchased once with full source code provided.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- Sendy remains popular for its economics but is hindered by PHP legacy, dated interface, marketing-only focus, and increasingly fragile setup.
- ListMonk offers transactional but lacks polish and AI capabilities.
- SaaS alternatives are expensive ($29–$199+/mo) and create vendor lock-in.
- No self-hosted solution combines marketing + transactional + AI-native tooling.
- Indie creators want predictable ultra-low costs, full data ownership, and modern performance as lists scale to 100k+ subscribers.

---

## 3. Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Indie hackers, solopreneurs, and creators with newsletters
- Bootstrapped founders needing unified email infrastructure
- Developers who value self-hosted, single-binary tools
- AI-forward users who want Claude/LLM integration

**Secondary:**
- Small teams/agencies managing multiple client lists
- Anyone migrating from Sendy seeking a modern upgrade
- ListMonk users wanting better UX and AI capabilities

---

## 4. Goals & Success Metrics

**Primary:** ≥50 paid sales in first 10 days → continue development per 10-in-100 challenge

**Secondary:** 200+ total sales in first 30 days, strong organic traction in indie communities

## 6. MCP Integration & AI-Powered Email

### Overview

Outlet.sh includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with embedded OAuth, enabling AI assistants like Claude to directly manage email operations. This is the feature no competitor has.

### Embedded OAuth Server

- Full OAuth 2.0 implementation built into Outlet.sh binary
- Secure token-based authentication for MCP connections
- No external auth dependencies
- Scoped permissions per integration

### MCP Server Capabilities

The MCP server exposes tools for AI assistants to:

**List & Subscriber Management:**
- `list_create` / `list_get` / `list_list`
- `subscriber_add` / `subscriber_update` / `subscriber_search`
- `tag_add` / `tag_remove`

**Campaign Operations:**
- `campaign_create` / `campaign_schedule` / `campaign_send`
- `template_create` / `template_list`

**Sequence Building:**
- `sequence_create` / `sequence_get` / `sequence_list`
- `sequence_email_add` / `sequence_email_update`
- `sequence_email_delete`

**Transactional:**
- `transactional_send`
- `transactional_template_create`

**Analytics:**
- `stats_campaign` / `stats_sequence` / `stats_transactional`
- `subscriber_activity`

### AI-Powered Workflows

With MCP integration, users can:

```
User: "Create a 7-day welcome sequence for my SaaS. 
       Day 1 should introduce the product, Day 3 cover the main feature,
       Day 5 share a case study, Day 7 offer a discount."

Claude: [Creates sequence, adds 4 emails with proper delays, 
        writes copy, sets triggers — all via MCP tools]
```

```
User: "Show me which emails in my onboarding sequence 
       have the lowest open rates"

Claude: [Queries stats, analyzes, recommends subject line changes]
```

```
User: "Add everyone who clicked the pricing link 
       to my 'high intent' segment"

Claude: [Creates tag, sets up automation rule]
```

### Why This Matters

- **No competitor has this.** Sendy, ListMonk, and SaaS platforms require manual operation.
- **Democratizes email marketing.** Non-technical users describe what they want; AI builds it.
- **Proven pattern.** Already working in Levee with Brandivize sequences.
- **Defensible moat.** Easy to copy features, hard to copy AI-native architecture.

---

## 7. Backup System Architecture

### Why This Matters

SQLite's single-file database is a feature, not a limitation. One file = one backup = complete data portability. Users' email lists are their most valuable asset—backup must be trivial.

### Dashboard-First Configuration

All backup settings configured in **Settings → Backup** (no YAML required):

**Manual Backup:**
- "Download Backup" button → browser downloads `outlet-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.db`
- "Backup Now" button → immediate S3 backup (if configured)

**S3 Automated Backup:**
- Toggle: Enable S3 Backup
- Bucket name
- Region (dropdown)
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key (encrypted at rest)
- Schedule: Daily / Every 12 hours / Every 6 hours / Hourly
- Retention: X days (auto-cleanup of old backups)
- "Test Connection" button (validates before saving)

**Backup History Table:**
- Timestamp, size, location (local/S3), status
- One-click restore button per backup
- One-click download button for S3 backups

### Technical Implementation

- `robfig/cron` for scheduling (goroutine, no external dependencies)
- SQLite Online Backup API (safe during live writes)
- Credentials encrypted in SQLite using same pattern as SES keys
- Failure notifications via configured email address

### Restore Process

**From Dashboard:**
- Click restore button next to any backup in history
- Or upload a backup file directly

**Manual:**
1. Stop Outlet.sh
2. Replace `outlet.db` with backup file
3. Start Outlet.sh
4. Goose verifies/runs any needed migrations
5. Done

### Backup Contents

The single `outlet.db` file contains everything:
- All subscribers and custom fields
- All lists and tags
- All campaigns and sequences
- All templates (marketing + transactional)
- All analytics/tracking data
- All automation rules
- All settings (including encrypted S3/SES credentials)

---

## 8. Deployment

### Option 1: Direct Binary

**Download and run:**
```bash
wget https://outlet.sh/download/outlet-linux-amd64
chmod +x outlet-linux-amd64
./outlet-linux-amd64
```

**Systemd service for auto-restart:**

Create `/etc/systemd/system/outlet.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Outlet.sh Email Platform
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=outlet
WorkingDirectory=/opt/outlet
ExecStart=/opt/outlet/outlet
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable outlet
sudo systemctl start outlet
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

Create `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  outlet:
    image: outlet/outlet:latest
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: always
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**That's it.** Data persists in `./data/outlet.db`. Backups, updates, config—all in the dashboard.

---

## 9. Technical Pattern (Based on Brandivize Precedent)

Follow the proven Brandivize main.go pattern:

- Embedded config (//go:embed etc/outlet.yaml)
- go-zero REST server with custom options
- Global security headers middleware
- Levee integration (optional but available for shared backend features)
- **Production mode:**
  - Let's Encrypt autocert on :443
  - HTTP → HTTPS + www → non-www redirects
  - Reverse proxy to internal go-zero server
  - Proper WebSocket proxying
  - Embedded SPA serving with fallback
- **Development mode:** direct server on configured port, localhost host
- Graceful shutdown handling

---

## 10. Auto-Update Architecture

### Update Flow

```
User runs: outlet update
    ↓
Binary calls license.outlet.sh with license key
    ↓
Server validates:
  - Valid license? 
  - Minor version? → Return download URL
  - Major version? → Return "upgrade required" + purchase link
    ↓
Binary downloads new version to temp location
    ↓
Binary replaces itself, restarts
    ↓
On startup, Goose detects pending migrations
    ↓
Migrations run automatically
    ↓
Updated and running
```

### CLI

```bash
outlet
```

That's it. Config is embedded. Server starts. Everything else happens in the dashboard.

### Dashboard Integration

**Settings → License**
- Enter license key
- View license tier and status
- Upgrade tier link

**Settings → Updates**
- Current version display
- "Check for Updates" button
- "Install Update" button (when available)
- Update history log
- Major version upgrade purchase link (when applicable)

**Settings → Backup**
- Download backup button
- S3 configuration (bucket, region, credentials, schedule, retention)
- Test connection button
- Backup history with restore buttons

**Settings → MCP**
- Enable/disable MCP server
- OAuth client management
- Connection status
- Integration guide link

### License Server (license.outlet.sh)

Minimal service responsibilities:
- Validate license keys against purchase records
- Track version entitlements (v1.x vs v2.x)
- Serve signed download URLs for entitled versions
- Log update check activity (engagement metrics)

### Database Migrations

- Goose embedded in binary
- Migrations bundled in binary via go:embed
- Auto-run on startup when schema version mismatch detected
- Rollback capability via `outlet migrate down`

### No Hard Enforcement

- Software runs without license server connectivity
- License key gates access to updates, not functionality
- Full source code ships with purchase
- Honor system for instance limits (see Pricing)
